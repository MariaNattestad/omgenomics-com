When I started OMGenomics in 2017 I had an email newsletter, but I have since stopped doing that because everything I wanted to say, I just ended up saying in my YouTube videos on the [OMGenomics channel](http://youtube.com/omgenomics).

If you want to stay updated on what I'm putting out there, the YouTube channel is the best place to go, and if you follow me on Twitter, you'll also get the occasional tweet about what my team and I are up to in my day-job building genomics software.
