Hi I'm Maria Nattestad.

I first started OMGenomics right after finishing my PhD at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory as an experiment with entrepreneurship. After 6 months working on it full time, I realized I wasn't as much of an introvert as I thought I was :) and decided to get a job in industry like I had originally planned.

While I'm not working on OMGenomics full time anymore, I still regularly support old and new customers of [Circa](/circa/) and [Chordial](http://marianattestad.com/chordial), and I occasionally make new videos for the [OMGenomics YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/omgenomics).
