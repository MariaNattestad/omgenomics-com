## "Before Circa, it took me a week to make a circos plot"

That's a quote from one of our customers, and they are not alone. This is something we hear a lot.

Of course it takes time to find the right bioinformatics tools for your analysis and interpret the results correctly, but seriously, why should it take you **several days** to create a circos plot?

You've seen circos plots in papers before and you know they are a great way to show genome-wide data like variants, copy number profiles, and epigenetic data across all chromosomes at once. A great circos plot in figure 1 can give a wonderful visual overview of your work before diving deeper in the rest of the paper. So you set out to make a circos plot.

## This is taking forever

Maybe you have even made a circos plot yourself in the past by writing a complex config file for Circos itself or used one of the R libraries that are supposed to make it easier, but it is still surprisingly frustrating and time-consuming.

You're willing to research for many hours to find the best way to do your science right, but to just visualize the results, that really shouldn't take several days!

> I struggled for over three days in graduate school to make my first circos plot, and I still wasn't completely happy with it! That's why I decided to build Circa. Now I can make that same circos plot in 60 seconds.

## With Circa, you will build a circos plot from your own genomic data in less than an hour.

You probably had to do a fair amount of coding and complex data analysis to get your data to the point where you have results worth visualizing.

With Circa you can take a break from the command-line and create an entire beautiful circos plot **without writing a single line of code** (or configuration files!).

## There are many ways to plot your data in Circa

## Save and share your Circa plots

You can share circa plots with other people. When you save a plot, it generates a .circa file that includes everything your collaborator needs to see and edit the plot in Circa on their own computer. Just like Word or Photoshop files, if your colleague also has Circa on her computer, she can edit your plot, add data to it, restyle it, and export new images.

## Save your publication-quality plot

With Circa, you can save in PNG or SVG format. PNG is a normal image that you can easily use in drafts and presentations, while SVG is completely scalable and has infinite resolution. The SVG plot you get from Circa can also be edited in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape, where you can also save it as a PDF.

## Who is Circa not for?

Circa is very easy to use, but doing bioinformatics is always going to be a challenge, and not everyone is comfortable doing analysis and formatting their data themselves. I have received requests for help like "I have this FASTA file, now what?", which I cannot help with, and I don't want any of you who are in that boat to buy Circa and then be disappointed that I can't help you do bioinformatics, format your data, or build the plot for you. So, if you fit into any of the following below, you are not ready to use Circa yet, and I encourage you to wait to purchase Circa until your data is completely ready for it.

### Circa is not for you if:

<ul><li>If you don't know what your reference genome is and where your data points go on that reference genome</li><li>If you haven't figured out the bioinformatics analysis yet -- Circa only does the plotting, not the analysis, so for example, FASTQ, FASTA, and BAM files need some work before they become data points you can plot.</li><li>If you can't make CSV or TSV files from your data -- Circa needs these (or a VCF &lt; 10 MB) where each line is a data point.</li><li>If your data points don't have chromosomes and basepair positions attached to them -- Circa needs to know this about every data point so it can plot them onto the genome's coordinates.</li></ul>
