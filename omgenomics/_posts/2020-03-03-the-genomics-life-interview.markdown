Kelly Moffat has a great podcast called "The Genomics Life" where she interviews people in the genomics field.

I was honored to do one of her first interviews for the podcast, and I figured I would cross-post it here in case viewers of OMGenomics are interested: [The Genomics Life podcast interview with Maria Nattestad](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dr-maria-nattestad-on-visualizing-complexities-genomes/id1500134545?i=1000467405299).
