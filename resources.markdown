# Resources I often recommend

## Courses

* [Conquering Data Analysis in R](https://omgenomics.teachable.com/p/conquering-data-analysis-in-r) (plugging my own course here): An introduction to data analysis, plotting, data wrangling, statistics, and PCA in R for beginners. This is a paid course, but if you are looking for something free, I have an older course called [Plotting in R for biologists](http://marianattestad.com/blog) that covers some of the same topics.
* [Genomic Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science) from Johns Hopkins on Coursera. Within that specialization I especially recommend Ben Langmeadâ€™s course, and you can watch those videos on his YouTube channel too: [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2mpR0RYFQsBiCWVJSvVAO3OJ2t7DzoHA).
* [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course) is great for learning the fundamental concepts in machine learning and using TensorFlow.

## Tools

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for writing code/scripts (and where I'm typing this text for the website right now).
* [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) as a replacement for the built-in terminal on Mac.

## Books

* [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://smile.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2OLMT451381H&dchild=1&keywords=so+good+they+cant+ignore+you&qid=1609014893&sprefix=so+good+they+%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-1) and [Deep Work](https://smile.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=deep+work&qid=1609014903&sr=8-1) by Cal Newport. I always recommend these two books to anyone interested in creating a good career -- so basically everyone.
* [Range](https://smile.amazon.com/Range-Generalists-Triumph-Specialized-World/dp/0735214484/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=range&qid=1609014987&sr=8-1) by David Epstein helped me appreciate the strengths of taking a winding path in my career.
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://smile.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?crid=CXUGYI761776&dchild=1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1609015091&s=books&sprefix=cracking%2Caps%2C248&sr=1-1) helped me prepare for the interviews at Google. I have gotten similar whiteboard coding interviews at some biotech companies too, though it's not as standardized or ubiquitous as at the [FAANG](https://www.google.com/search?q=faang) companies.
